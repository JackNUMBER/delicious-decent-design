#Delicious Decent Design

I created this to patch the current Delicious design. Since the acquisition by Science Inc the design is really ugly. I'm trying to normalize it and make it usable, step by step.
Come back to the previous design (made by [Tunghsiao Liu](https://sparanoid.com/work/delicious/)) is maybe a goal. I don't know again, currently I just want to make it less terrible.

:shit: Don't be shocked, there is some crapy code. Current Delicious CSS is really bad and to overide it, dirty code is mandatory.

##How to
To apply this patch to Delicious, install the **Stylish** extension for browser (Chrome/Firefox).
Then copy/paste the style.css code and define the domain to `del.icio.us`.

##Next
This project is in progress.
